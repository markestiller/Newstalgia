## Inspiration üí°

The inspiration behind Newstalgia was to merge the contemporary world of news with a nostalgic and timeless presentation. We aimed to create a platform that delivers today's headlines in a format that evokes the charm and sentimentality of the past.

## What it does ‚≠êÔ∏è

Newstalgia not only transforms the presentation of today's headlines into a nostalgic format but also comes equipped with a charming Hamtaro-inspired chatbot. This delightful chatbot serves as a personal assistant, helping users understand the content of the news in a friendly and engaging manner. Whether you're looking for summaries, additional information, or a touch of whimsical conversation, the Hamtaro-inspired chatbot adds a unique and personalized dimension to your news exploration experience.

## How we built it üíª 

**Design**: The creative process kicked off with sketching and ideation on Goodnotes, followed by the design work on Figma. This ensured a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

**Front-end**: Our front-end development was powered by a dynamic combination of Vite, React, and TailwindCSS. Leveraging these cutting-edge technologies allowed us to create a responsive and aesthetically pleasing user interface, ensuring an engaging experience for our audience.

**Back-end**: For a robust and scalable server infrastructure, we turned to Node.js and Express.js. These backend technologies enabled us to handle data efficiently, ensuring seamless communication between the frontend and various APIs.

**APIs**: Our chatbot functionality was made possible through Cohere's ChatAPI. To compile the latest news, we utilized NewsAPI. This cohesive use of APIs added depth and variety to the content delivered through Newstalgia.

## Challenges we ran into üß©

The intricacies of Cohere's ChatAPI presented an initial hurdle for our team. Understanding its functionality and integrating it seamlessly into our project took some time, as we delved into its features to ensure an effective implementation.

On the frontend, our team encountered a challenge related to styling. One of our members was more familiar and comfortable with traditional CSS, while another preferred TailwindCSS. Bridging the gap between these two styling approaches led to some initial code conflicts, resulting in styling issues that required careful collaboration and problem-solving to resolve.

Another significant challenge revolved around the design phase. Crafting a layout that perfectly encapsulated the nostalgic theme posed a creative challenge. It took considerable time and iteration to strike the right balance, ensuring that the design not only resonated with elements from the past but also met the expectations of a modern audience.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of üèÜ

We take immense pride in successfully implementing a visually captivating design that not only captures the essence of nostalgia but is also inspired by the timeless aesthetics of renowned publications like The New York Times. Our team achieved a harmonious blend of modern functionality and the distinctive retro elements, drawing inspiration from the iconic design principles of publications such as The New York Times. 

## What we learned üß†

This project stands out as one of the most frontend-centric projects each team member has undertaken, providing us with a lot of insights into the intricacies of making design decisions. We navigated through the challenges of crafting visually compelling and user-friendly interfaces, deepening our understanding of the science behind frontend development.

A notable highlight of our learning journey was harnessing the power of LLMs, exemplified by Cohere's Chat API. This experience not only broadened our technical horizons but also revolutionized our understanding of natural language processing.

## What's next for Newstalgia üîÆ

In the future, we envision elevating the Newstalgia experience by introducing a vibrant comments section, providing users with a platform to engage in discussions about the latest news. This interactive feature will foster a sense of community, allowing users to share perspectives and insights.

Additionally, our roadmap includes infusing an element of gamification into the Newstalgia concept. Users can look forward to enjoying engaging activities such as crossword puzzles and other interactive challenges. This addition aims to not only inform but also entertain, creating a well-rounded and immersive experience for our audience.
